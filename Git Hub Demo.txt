Git & GIT HUB
--------------------

Git is basically called as a version control system.

with the help of this we can mainatain the versions of over codes.

Git Hub -- it is a repository where we can add our codes.

Version downgrade and version upgrade is easily possible with git system

when we create a code our code is in my System (local location)

which i want to add to some remote location which is github.com

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To work with the github you need to do 2 things

download git hub software and install it your system (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

create account on github.com

Login to your Github account
-----------------------------------------------

click on new to create new Repository

give repo name: firstApplication

give some description scroll down and click on create repository.

(you can see some set of commands)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open cmd and check git version

>git version (you can see the git version if git is installed in your local system)

Now move to the folder which you want to upload to Github repository.

if you want to change the drive then type D: or E:

in same drive if you want to chnage the folder then use cd command (change directory)

example:

 D:
 cd foldername

(means now you are in your folder)

______________________________________________________________

once you in your folder then initialized git in that folder

git init (execute in cmd)

2nd step is to configure github account

git config --global user.email "sonam@gmail.com"

3rd step is to add the files to staging area

git add .

4th step is to add staging area files to local repository

git commit -m "this is my first version"

5th step is to set up the branch

git branch -M main

6th set remote origin

git remote add origin https://github.com/sonam-niit/FirstApplication.git

7th step is to push code to remote repository

git push -u origin main

(when you execute this command first time it will ask you for authentication so select browser authentication
so it will pop up the browser where you need to enter your github password. once that is varified you can refresh your repository and check the codes available on repo)

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

This you need to set up once

from the next time if you change any files or folders then execute below commnads only
first move to that folder using cd command
git add .
git commit -m "version 1.1"
git push -u origin main
